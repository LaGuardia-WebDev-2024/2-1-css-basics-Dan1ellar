    <h2>Basic Info</h2>

    <p>
      <em>Bernese mountain dogs </em> are awesome because they are Swiss working
      dogs.Don't be misled by their big size! Berners are sensitive, extremely
      devoted and above all, super sweet dogs. The Bernese Mountain Dog breed
      will suit a home-loving owner who has space for this gentle giant, likes
      grooming and enjoys an affectionate but not particularly active companion.
